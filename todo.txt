Oddities:
    Scroll up in fileexplorer
    Open w/ args can crash
    table.insert in addChild leads to stack overflow
    #If a program is opened in edit mode by fileExplorer and then executed it leads to the native term being used 
    #When focus is grabbed after a window is closed the os freezes (see fileExplorer close)
    #Input gets empty data from pullEvent (I think when event is timer)
    #Selecting windows throug toolbar doesn't work
    #Dropdown menu is at wrong position
    #A program that constantly checks for the resize event will constantly trigger redraw
    #Multishell will take priority over main os
    #If pressed is used instead of click in settings then the entire window becomes a button
    #See programViewport launchProgram function
