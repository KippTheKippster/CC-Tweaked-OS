If a window opens another window something strange happens with its term (see event_test.lua) (some kind of multishellWrapper issue)
key_up is sent to unfocused windows
__Globals isn't sent if a program is run through edit mode
When dragging window the programViewport should not get the mouse_drag event
Make a copy theme function
Delete key in files is weird
VContainer size is not set to zero when it has no children and fitToChildren is true
V/HContainer does not respect margin
If two toplevel objects lay on top of each other the click order is wrong
LineEdit: if you are trying to erase with cursor to the far left then it will copy all text
