#Renderbuffer
#Resize should update correctly
#Scroll is not working
#Show cursor
#Make global function and variables local

File explorer functionality:
    Rename file
    Create file
    Remove file
    Scroll

Oddities:
    A program that constantly checks for the resize event will constantly trigger redraw
    Multishell will take priority over main os
