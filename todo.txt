If a window opens another window something strange happens with its term (see event_test.lua)
key_up is sent to unfocused windows
__Globals isn't sent if a program is run through edit mode
When dragging window the programViewport should not get the mouse_drag event
Move open with args to mos instead of file explorer (fix so that holding alt for mos favorites works)
If a directory is selected through favorites open file explorer
Make a copy theme function
Delete key in files is weird
VContainer size is not set to zero when it has no children and fitToChildren is true
V/HContainer does not respect margin
If two toplevel objects lay on top of each other the click order is wrong
